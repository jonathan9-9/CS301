Q1: Explain what we mean by "data abstraction"?

A: Data abstraction refers to the delineation of a data types logical properties from its implementation. In
other words, it is a way to separate the computer's view of data from humans' view of data; it is about
knowing only about the operations that can be performed on the data not the small details of how to implement,
in code, the data to simplify complexity through abstraction and focus on what matters


Q2: Explain "data encapsulation". What is the programming goal once we use encapsulation?

A: Data encapsulation essentially is wrapping the data and methods or functions that operate
on the data and limiting access to parts of objects. A programming language that provides
a data type and operations to perform on that data by function or within classes. The
programming goal of encapsulation is creating modular code so that the code is well
structured and reusable while also preventing direct access to objects to prevent unintended
modifications
